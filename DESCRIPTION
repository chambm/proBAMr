Description: The interpretation of proteomics data is significantly enhanced by genomic annotation. 
    Using proBAMr, peptide-spectrum-matches can be easily reannotated using user-specified gene annotation 
    schemes and assembled into both protein and gene identifications. Using the genome as a common reference, 
    proBAMr facilitates seamless proteomics and proteogenomics data integration. ProBAM files can be readily 
    visualized in genome browsers and thus bring proteomics data analysis to a general audience beyond the 
    proteomics community.
